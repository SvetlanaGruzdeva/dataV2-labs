Challenge 2
One player picks two cards from a poker deck. Describe the measurable space and the random variable for:

A. The number of figures he picks.
	The measurable space will be 2562 possbile outcomes:
	52 cards for first card multiplied by 51 possible cards for the second card
	Random variable will be any pair of cards, for example 2 of hearts and 2 of clubs.

B. The sum of card values. Consider that the value of figures is 10 and the value of aces is 15.
	The measurable space will be as list below (18 possbile outcomes):
	4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 30
	Random variable will be sum of any pair of cards, for example 2 of hearts and ace of clubs will give 17 in total.

C. The number of hearts or spades he picks.
	The measurable space will be 650 possible outcomes:
	13 cards of each card suit = 26, so 26 possibilities for the first card and 25 for the second.

Describe the following events:

Case A: The number of figures in the cards the player picked is two.
	It can be one of the following pairs (76 possible cards in total):
JackH		QueenH	KingH	AceH		JackS	JackC	JackD

JackD					JackH	JackS	JackC	
QueenD					QueenH	QueenS	QueenC	
KingD					KingH	KingS	KingC	
AceD					AceH	AceS	AceC	

Case B: The sum of card values is 17.
	It's a pair of either Ace & two or 10 & 7, or any figure & 7 (all cards can be any suit).

Case C: The value of both cards is less than 8.
	It can be one of the combinations from the matrix below (196 possible pairs):
2H	3H	4H	5H	2S	3S	4S	5S	2C	3C	4C	5C	2D	3D	4D	5D

Challenge 3
Two players roll a dice. Describe the measurable space and the random variable for:

A. The score of player A.
	Assuming that score is a number rolled by player:
	The measurable space will be any number in a range from 1 to 6 inclusive.
	Random variable will also be any number in this range.

B. The greatest score.
	Assuming that each player rolls only once and that they are playing against each other, i.e. we evaluating each
	score separatelly and don't sum them up:
		The measurable space will be the same as above, any number in a range from 1 to 6 inclusive.
		Random variable will also be any number in this range.

C. The earnings of player A if the game rules state that:
"The player with the greatest score gets a coin from the other player.".
	The measurable space will be one coin or no coins (0 & 1) as there are only 2 possible outcomes: player A 
	either rolls the number greater than player B or not.
	Random variable will either 0 or 1.

D. The earnings of player A if the game rules state that:
"The player with the greatest score gets as many coins as the difference between the score of player A and player B.".
	The measurable space will be any number in a range from 1 to 5 inclusive.
	Random variable will also be any number in this range.

Describe the following events:

Case A: The score of player A is 2.
	Assuming that score is a number rolled by player:
	player A rolled 2 on a die.

Case B: The greatest score is lower or equal than 2.
	Assuming that score is a number rolled by player:
	Both players rolled 1, both players rolled 2 or one of the players rolled 1 and another rolled 2 (4 possible
	outcomes if order matters).

Case C: Considering the case where the winner gets as many coins as the difference between scores (D), describe:
Player A wins at least 4 coins.
	There is one of the following pairs on the table:
		6(A) & 2(B)
		5(A) & 1(B)

Player A loses more than 2 coins.
	So he loses eighter 3, 4 or 5.
	There is one of the following pairs on the table:
		6(B) & 3(A)
		6(B) & 2(A)
		6(B) & 1(A)
		5(B) & 2(A)
		5(B) & 1(A)
		4(B) & 1(A)	

Player A neither wins nor loses coins.
	There is a tie on the table:
	1-1, 2-2, 3-3, 4-4, 5-5, 6-6
