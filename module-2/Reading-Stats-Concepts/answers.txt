Challenge 1: What is the difference between expected value and mean?

Expected value is weigthed average where mean is just arithmetic average, i.e. expected value takes into account probability of each value.
Expected value and mean might be synonims if population we analyse takes into account probablity of each value.


Challenge 2: What is the "problem" in science with p-values?

P-value may vary from experiment to experiment due to various reasons (i.e. size of population or it's diversity) so different experiments
checking the same theory might give different p-values in the end. It means that only p-value is not enough to evaluate results,
other parameters should be also taken into account together with p-value.


Challenge 3: Applying testing to a specific case: A/B testing.
Basecamp example.
For the situation described by data secialist of Basecamp I don't see easy straightforward way to create testing enviroment.
Main issue I see to make sure your focus group is representative and it's easy to arrange for known customers (as in an example from
Netflix, for instanse) but in case of Basecamp we're speaking about potential clients, i.e. background of user analysed is unclear.
How to specify their occupation? Or country? Yes, there are IPs but what if person is using VPN? Or some other characteristics that might
be relevant to a change we're testing? Maybe it's worth to set up small pop-up form for all unregistered users entering the site and then
to split them between focus group and control group.
Also it's important to take into account seasoning of demand. Probably it's a good idea to start testing in the beggining of the year
where level of new subscriptions is usually high, I will allow to sorten testing time getting representative results at the same time.
