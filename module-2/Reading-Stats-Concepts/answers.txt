Challenge 1: What is the difference between expected value and mean?

Expected value is weigthed average where mean is just arithmetic average, i.e. expected value takes into account probability of each value.
Expected value and mean might be synonims if population we analyse takes into account probablity of each value.


Challenge 2: What is the "problem" in science with p-values?

P-value may vary from experiment to experiment due to various reasons (i.e. size of population or it's diversity) so different experiments
checking the same theory might give different p-values in the end. It means that only p-value is not enough to evaluate results,
other parameters should be also taken into account together with p-value.


Challenge 3: Applying testing to a specific case: A/B testing.
